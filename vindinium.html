    <h1>Vindinium game</h1>
    <h3>What is Vindinium?</h3>
    <p> Vindinium is a simple Ai game which lets the player modify their character to do something in specific for example, the 
    player could make the bot go directly to mines and kill the nearest weakest player or you can just make your character go after other 
    enemy players and then go after some mines so the possobilities are endless! The main priority on the game is to be able to get as many mines and in order to get all 
    the gold coins to win!</p>
    
    <h3>How my bot works!</h3>
 <p>  
My Bot works by starting off by going for free mines and after they are all taken my bot can sometimes attack an enemy once just to warn them.
    also i made my bot go to get mines and in a couple minutes he would automatically go back to the taverns to regain health. 
    i chose that because i think mines and health are more important than fighting other players</p>

    <h3>my code</h3>
