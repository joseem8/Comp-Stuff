  <p style="color: blue;">What is a Motherboard and what does it do</p>
  <p>Motherboards or Main Boards are the primary source that links your computer processor unit (CPU), your memory, and hardware. Think of the motherboard as the veins of the computer.</p>

  <h3 style="color:blue;">what is a Cpu and what does it do?</h3>
    <p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit performs the calculations and logic functions of the computer. CPU's only perform the most basic of functions, such as adding the contents of a memory location to the contents of a CPU "register", or comparing the contents of one register to the contents of another register and "jump" on a specified condition such as "equal to", "greater than" or "less than".</p>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">What is RAM and what does it do?</h3>
    <p>AM (Random Access Memory) or main memory is where a computer stores programs, applications or data that is being used. Essentially the more RAM a computer has the more programs the computer can run simultaneously without showing a large slowdown in performance</p>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">What is a hard drive and what does it do?</h3>
    <p>Alternatively referred to as a hard disk drive and abbreviated as HD or HDD, the hard drive is the computer's main storage media device that permanently stores all data on the computer.

    <h3 style="color: blue;">What is a power supply and what does it do?</h3>
    <p> Power supply unit (computer) A power supply unit (PSU) converts mains AC to low-voltage regulated DC power for the internal components of a computer.</p>

    <h3 style="color:blue;">how do different components communicate with eachother?</h3>
    <p>Computer components are connected to each other via thin connections known as 'bus' on the motherboard.

The devices follow a communication protocol defined by IEEE. Protocols tend to differ for each type of device / bus.

Since multiple devices can be connected to the same bus, the communications are handled by the 'bus controller'.

Devices that can directly communicate with other devices without involving the main CPU and RAM are called 'bus mastering' devices.
